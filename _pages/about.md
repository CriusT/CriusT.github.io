I am a computer systems researcher currently working at a stealth startup developing innovative LLM infrastructure. I received my Ph.D. from the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Science (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was advised by [Prof. Mingyu Gao](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/). Prior to joining Tsinghua, I earned my bachelor's degree from the [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interests span diverse areas within computer systems. I am currently focusing on efficient, scalable and reliable infrastructure for the full lifecycle of AI agents. My Ph.D. research specialized in memory-centric architecture design, exploring innovative approaches such as near-data processing, memory pooling, and memory disaggregation to optimize system performance and energy efficiency.
