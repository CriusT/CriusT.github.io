I am a Ph.D. student in [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Science (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Mingyu Gao](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/). Before joining Tsinghua, I obtained a bachelor's degree from the [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research interests mainly lie in the fields of efficient memory architectures and scalable data processing. I am currently focusing on architectures that follow the Near-Data Processing paradigm.
